# Texted

A web-based application able to calculate the readability and similarity of a text.


## Purpose

This is the Final Project for the Harvard's "Introduction to the Intellectual Enterprises of Computer Science and the Art of Programming" - CS50's Web Track.
[CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/)


## Description

Calculates the readability of a given text according to the "Coleman–Liau Index" and presents the result indicating the average grade and age of a person expected to easily read and understand the text.

Estimates the lexical similarty between two given texts according to the following linguistic traces: Type-token relation, Hapax legomenon ratio, words, sentences and phase complexity and average size. Presents the level of similarity between the texts in percentage (%).

The project was inspired by a problem set called "Readability" presented by the CS50's program in weeks 2 and 6.
